# TCPCam: remote control your camera

A request-response IoT server, implementing multiple concurrent client connections, image streaming and on-demand image capture requests over TCP.
A simple Linux client (in C) is provided for testing purposes.

## Hardware requirements
- ESP32-CAM board. 
  It is possible to build for other ESP32 boards without camera support.
- Wifi connection and (optionally) Internet
- 5V or 3.3V power source (5V, if applicable for a board, works better with WiFi).

## Software prerequisites
This project uses the [*ESP IDF*](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf "ESP-IDF on Github") Integrated Development Environment.
See [installation instructions](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/get-started/index.html#installation-step-by-step "install and setup ESP IDF") for more details about IDE.

GCC or similar, and GNU Make or similar for the included client.

## Configure and build TCPCam

### Getting the source code
Clone (or fork) this repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/rytis-paskauskas/TCPCam
```

### Configuration
```sh
idf.py menuconfig
```
Customize TCPCam-related parameters in the "TCPCam Configuration" section.

### Build and flash
This project for the server follows the [standard ESP-IDF build workflow](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/get-started/index.html#step-6-connect-your-device "ESP IDF build workflow"). 

The client can be built using the included `Makefile` but it is simple enough to be built manually.

### Build types 
It is possible to build for ESP32 without camera support using the provided test builds. 

Also, it should be possible to extend this app to other camera sensors by replacing `esp32cam.c` with an appropriate driver and providing a custom frame generator (this has not been tested).

The menuconfig's *"Image and Streaming settings > Build type"* section provides several build options. 

The *"Build with ESP32-CAMERA sensor"* option should be chosen for 'production' builds. 

The other two build types can be used for testing purposes:
- *"Hello World"* repeatedly transmits a string
- *"Build with a JPEG test binary"* repeatedly transmits a sample image file

## Client
Saving the received images as files, or passing them to a HTTP streaming server are two probable use types by a hypothetical client.

Any suitable client, adaptable to TCPCam's simple protocol, described [below](#server-request-protocol), could be used.

A simple (and optional) Linux client is provided with this project for testing purposes. 
It is a client vanilla implementation using BSD socket library. The GNU Make system *might* be necessary to build it.
```sh
cd client; make
```

## Usage
The server connects to the WiFi AP with provided credentials and listens to incoming connections on the specified port. All communications are unencrypted and use the same port.

A client should first establish the connection with the server on specified IP address and port (see `menuconfig` and "TCP server settings"). After a successful connection, it is possible to send requests.

### Server request protocol
A server request shall consist of PIN followed by COMMAND sent separately in this order. These two commands are required to initiate the connection. Neither command will be confirmed by server.
If the initiation request is successful, a stream will start arriving on the same port.

The commands are
1. PIN code as specified in `menuconfig` "TCP server settings > TCP pin/password"
2. CODE, the app supports numeric code values:
   - positive number `N` will request exactly N frames
   - zero or negative number will request a non-stop stream
  
It is possible to connect multiple clients simultaneously. Each connection will be served in turn in LIFO order.

### Client
The provided Linux client connects with credentials and dumps the payload to `stdout` or to a file. Usage:
```sh
TCPCam_client IP PORT PIN REP [FNAME]
```
Here
- IP:   IP address of server
- PORT:  TCP port as set in menuconfig
- PIN: pin/password as set in menuconfig
- REP: number of messages to wait for. Put 0 for indefinite transmission.
- FNAME: *optional* If specified the payload will be directed to a file instead of `stdout`. In case of multiple frames, they will be appended.

## TODO
- [ ] better file handling in `TCPCam_client` (multiple files)
- [ ] make a python client
